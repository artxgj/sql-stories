My favorite [Postgres/SQL tutorial](https://pgexercises.com) is created by Alisdair Owens. Another good SQL resource that has caught my interest is [Modern SQL](http://modern-sql.com/).

To reinforce what I have been learning from these resources, I created this repo to store my own SQL exercises, which also serve as my notes.
